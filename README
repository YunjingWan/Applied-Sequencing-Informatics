METHOD

Raw RNA-Seq files were obtained as fastq.gz files, they were trimmed using Trim Galore on slurm (with parameter --length 30). 
Trimmed data were further aligned to Homo sapiens hg38 reference genome by Tophat2, and output files were sorted by samtools. 
Gene expression counts data were generated from sorted bam files by FeatureCounts. 
Tasks were submitted as array jobs in bash script. (See Tophat2.rtf and list.rtf)

Counts files were downloaded to local computer and then load into Rstudio for downstream analysis. 
Counts matrices were merged by experiments (PRAMEhi/PRAMElo) respectively. (See matrixhi.R and matrixlow.R). 

R package DESeq2 were used to perform differential analysis on both matrices. 
Pathway analysis was performed using R package ClusterProfiler. (See DESeq_hi.R and DESeq_low.R)
